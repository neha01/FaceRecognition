# Face Recognition

Face Recognition using OpenCV in Python

### Prerequisites

Numpy
OpenCV


### Installing

Install Numpy via anaconda:
conda install numpy

Install OpenCV via anaconda:
conda install -c menpo opencv


## Running the tests
1.Place some test images in TestImages folder to do a test run via tester.py file
2.Place Images for training the classifier in trainingImages folder.If you want to train clasifier to recognize multiple people then add each persons folder in separate label markes as 0,1,2,etc and then add their names along with labels in tester.py/videoTester.py file in 'name' variable.
3.To generate test images for training classifier use videoimg.py file.
4.To do test run via tester.py give the path of image in test_img variable
